    <td> Lyrics : [Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Caus–µ there we ar–µ again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

      <td>Lyrics : [Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the ACE-Step repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saba1999AI/Music_Generation
cd ACE-Step
```

### 2. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

* `Python`: Version 3.10 or later is recommended. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* `Conda` or `venv`: For creating a virtual environment (Conda is recommended).

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts. Choose one of the following methods:

#### Option A: Using Conda

1.  **Create the environment** named `ace_step` with Python 3.10:
    ```bash
    conda create -n ace_step python=3.10 -y
    ```

2.  **Activate the environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate ace_step
    ```

#### Option B: Using venv

1.  **Navigate to the cloned ACE-Step directory.**

2.  **Create the virtual environment** (commonly named `venv`):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv 
    ```

3.  **Activate the environment:**
    * **On Windows (cmd.exe):**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 
        ```
        *(If you encounter execution policy errors, you might need to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` first)*
    * **On Linux / macOS (bash/zsh):**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is activated:
**a.** (Windows Only) If you are on Windows and plan to use an NVIDIA GPU, install PyTorch with CUDA support first:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```
(Adjust cu126 if you have a different CUDA version. For other PyTorch installation options, refer to the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)).

**b.** Install ACE-Step and its core dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

The ACE-Step application is now installed. The GUI works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For instructions on how to run it, please see the [Usage](#-usage) section.


## üöÄ Usage


### üîç Basic Usage

```bash
acestep --port 7865
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage

```bash
acestep --checkpoint_path /path/to/checkpoint --port 7865 --device_id 0 --share true --bf16 true
```

* If `--checkpoint_path` is set and models exist at the path, load from `checkpoint_path`.
* If `--checkpoint_path` is set but models do not exist at the path, auto download models to `checkpoint_path`.
* If `--checkpoint_path` is not set, auto download models to the default path `~/.cache/ace-step/checkpoints`.

If you are using macOS, please use `--bf16 false` to avoid errors.
